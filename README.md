## Problem Statement

The increasing popularity of biking as a mode of transportation in London has prompted the need for a comprehensive analysis of bike usage patterns and the factors affecting them. This project aims to leverage data on bike counts, weather conditions, and temporal variables to uncover insights that can help city planners, environmentalists, and the general public make informed decisions. By understanding how factors like temperature, humidity, weather conditions, and wind speed influence bike usage, we can improve bike infrastructure, promote sustainable transportation, and enhance the overall biking experience in London.


### Data Description


The dataset includes the following variables:

-Time: The date and time of the recorded bike count.

-Count: The number of bikes counted.

-Temperature: The temperature at the time of recording (in degrees Celsius).

-Humidity: The humidity level at the time of recording (as a percentage).

-Weather: The weather conditions (e.g., clear, cloudy, rainy).

-Wind Speed: The wind speed at the time of recording (in kp/h).
        
### Dashboard Features

The Tableau dashboard provides:

-Time Series Analysis: Visualization of bike counts over time to identify trends and patterns.

-Weather Impact Analysis: Exploration of how different weather conditions affect bike usage.

-Temperature and Wind Speed Correlation: Analysis of the relationship between temperature, humidity, and bike counts.

# Insights
### Time Series Trends:

-Peak Usage Periods: Bike usage peaks during morning and evening rush hours on weekdays, indicating that a significant number of people use bikes for commuting to work.

-Seasonal Variations: Higher bike counts are observed during the warmer months (spring and summer), while usage declines in the colder months (autumn and winter).

### Weather Impact:

-Clear Weather: Bike counts are highest on clear and sunny days, suggesting that favorable weather conditions encourage more people to cycle.

-Rainy Weather: There is a noticeable drop in bike usage on rain with thunderstorm days, indicating that adverse weather conditions discourage biking.

### Temperature and Wind Speed:

-Optimal Temperature Range: Bike usage is highest within a specific temperature range (e.g., 15-20Â°C). Extreme temperatures (both hot and cold) see reduced bike counts.

-Moderate Wind: Moderate wind speeds do not significantly affect bike usage, suggesting that cyclists can tolerate light to moderate winds.

-High Wind: High wind speeds are associated with a decrease in bike usage, indicating that strong winds discourage cycling due to safety and comfort concerns.

### Daily Patterns:

-Weekend Usage: Bike usage patterns on weekends differ from weekdays, with increased counts in the late morning and afternoon, indicating recreational biking activity.

-Weekday Commute: Weekday bike counts show distinct peaks during typical commuting hours (8-9 AM and 5-6 PM).

### Correlation Analysis:

-Temperature vs. Bike Count: A positive correlation between temperature and bike counts, indicating that warmer weather encourages more biking.

-Wind Speed vs. Bike Count: A negative correlation between wind speed and bike counts, suggesting that higher wind speed levels discourage biking.

### Weather Conditions:

-Clear Days: Highest bike counts are typically on sunny days.

-Rain With Thunderstorm Days: Moderate bike counts, as cloud cover does not deter cyclists as much as rain does.
